      If you don't like smoking cigarettes without your consent (especially given how many <a href=https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5855#:~:text=Conclusions%20Smoking%20only%20about%20one,smoking%20exists%20for%20cardiovascular%20disease. target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> additional health risks</a> you take on by "only" smoking 1-5 cigarettes a day), please check out respiratory protection. There are a lot of great N95 masks available (e.g., the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/3M-9105-Particulate-Respirator-Regular/dp/B005KLZAYU/?tag=madewithmike-20 target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3M VFlex</a>, the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/3M-Aura-Particulate-Respirator-9205/dp/B095FJ36H2/?tag=madewithmike-20' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3M Aura</a>, or the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/3M-Particulate-Respirator-9502-Particulates/dp/B08NTS51JX?tag=madewithmike-20 target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>3M 9502+</a>) that will filter out the vast majority of PM2.5 particles and preserve your heart, brain, lungs, and other vital organs. You can buy them through my affiliate links to <a href='https://www.amazon.com/?tag=madewithmike-20' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Amazon</a>. I receive a few pennies when you do, which helps me pay for this sweet domain. Personally, I use the VFlex, but the Aura is another great choice, especially for people with smaller faces. As a bonus, any well-fitting N95 will also keep you from contracting just about any respiratory virus or bacteria in existence, as well as dramatically reduce the effects of pollen and other environmental allergens. 
      <br><br>
      Aside from N95s, it's also worth considering filtration through powered air purifiers for your home or office environment; even if you're fortunate enough to work from home and not deal wtih a commute or a toxic workplace, none of us are immune from climate change, whether through neverending (and ever-spreading) wildfires or run of the mill industrial pollution. You can build a Corsi-Rosenthal box with <a href=https://www.amazon.com/BNX-20x20x1-MERV-Filter-Pack/dp/B09XC3RQ3J/?tag=madewithmike-20 target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>4 air 20x20x1-inch HEPA filters</a>, a <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Speed-Box-20-Inch/dp/B08XKC9K14/?tag=madewithmike-20 target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>20-inch box fan</a>, and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Original-Strength-Duck-Silver-394475/dp/B0000DH4ME/?tag=madewithmike-20 target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>a roll of duct tape</a>; the whole setup will cost about as much as a couple tanks of gas or a few days of groceries, and you can get the same quality of filtration as that from <a href=https://www.amazon.com/LEVOIT-Purifiers-Monitor-Particles-Allergies/dp/B09BJMY8HL/?tag=madewithmike-20 target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>systems costing hundreds of dollars more</a>. Between my wife and I, we've made about 5 of these and once you make one, you realize it's no big deal to make more. And they work. Really well.
